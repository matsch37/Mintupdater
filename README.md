Linux Mint Update Helper Program

This program is a lightweight update helper for Linux Mint. I created it because I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the two options available for updating Linux Mint:

    Manual updates, which can be burdensome, especially for less experienced users.

    Automatic updates, which can be disruptive, such as restarting your browser (e.g., Firefox) mid-workflow.

This program aims to provide a middle ground.
What it does:

    Checks for updates at user-defined intervals (1, 4, 8, or 24 hours).

    Notifies the user when updates are available, with options to:

        Ask later

        Update now

        Always update at shutdown

    When the user clicks the shutdown button, the program rechecks for updates and presents a prompt with the options:

        Shutdown and update

        Shutdown without updating

Features:

    A control panel to configure the program's behavior:

        Set the interval for update checks

        Set the delaytime for Shutdown to 10 hours so updates can safely run.

        Enable or disable autostart of the program

        Start/stop the tool

        Enable or disable auto-update on shutdown

        Show update reminders even when auto-update on shutdown is enabled

This tool offers a flexible and user-friendly approach to updating your system without the inconvenience of full manual updates or disruptive automatic processes.
